Illumio Technical Assessment  
### Steps followed while solving the problem #####

1. Created the Lookup Table CSV (lookup_table.csv) with the necessary columns and Saved it in the same folder where the Python code is present.
containing columns dstport,protocol,tag attached the lookup_table.csv in the git repo


2. Created the Flow Logs File (flow_logs.txt) with the logs given in mail, attaching this as well in Git repo.

3. In the same location where both lookup_table.csv and flow_logs.txt are present saved the solution.py file which has the python code.

4. Ran the python code and successfully generated output files tag_counts.csv and port_protocol_counts.csv files


### Files attached in the Git repo ####

1. Input files-  lookup_table.csv, lookup_table.csv 
2. Python file containing the code or solution - solution.py
3. Output files generated by the code - tag_counts.csv , port_protocol_counts.csv

### Steps you need to follow in order to run the Code ####

1. Download or copy Input files - lookup_table.csv, lookup_table.csv
2. Download or copy solution or code in the same location where Input files are present - solution.py
3. Make sure you have a python installed in your system and run the solution.py file from the python editor of your choice.(Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm etc). I used PyCharm.
4. After running the code,  output files should be generated in the same folder.(Don't download the Output files from Git hub they will be generated by code added them in the git repo for reference).
5. Open the file to review the processed results and can cross verify with the output files i attached in the GitHub repo.
